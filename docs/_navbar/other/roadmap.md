# Roadmap

- Edit
  - [x] Paste the picture and upload it to joplin automatically and get the link to insert
    - [x] Support editor right-click menu to paste clipboard pictures
  - [x] Solve the problem that joplin ref link cannot be opened by `ctrl+click` in the editor

- Optimization

  - [ ] Add development related documents
  - [x] Fix the problem that the notes in the root directory cannot be displayed
  - [x] Support viewing attachment resources in external programs
    - [ ] Automatically monitor changes when opening the attachment resource, use the `child_process` returned by `open` - I intend to modify it to automatically close the monitoring changes of the resources in the note when the note is closed
      - Attachment resources can be added to multiple notes
  - [ ] Add outline title sidebar (waiting for api support, or implement it yourself <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97095>)

  - [x] Rename the note/directory directly in the input box - not supported by vscode api

  - [x] Right-click to modify the label information of the note, modify the rendering function to render the label - not intuitive, use the form of TreeViewProvider instead
  - [ ] Add a separate panel to display tags to add, delete and modify
    - [ ] Determine whether you can add a button and click to operate (such as delete)
- Organize vscode api usage
