# Quick start

> This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with VSCode, its Markdown environment, and the use of Joplin, just to quickly understand how to use plugins to combine them. If you have never contacted Joplin/VSCode, please check [Related Documents](_navbar/other/why).

## Install VSCode-Joplin plugin

Search for Joplin in VSCode's plug-in market and click install. After a while, the plug-in should be installed.

## Configure plugin

> Make sure you have enabled the Web Clipper service, refer to: [Joplin Web Clipper](https://joplinapp.org/clipper/)

Next, you need to configure the Joplin port and token for the plug-in. Generally, the port defaults to 41184. No configuration is required, just configure the token.

## Restart VSCode

For some reasons, currently Joplin cannot take effect immediately after configuration. You need to close VSCode and restart to reload the configuration.
